tropo-smalltalk
===============

Smalltalk implementation of the [Tropo](http://www.tropo.com) API.

**This code is in now way endorsed, supported, or verified by Tropo. I think they're ok with it and they know about it but its definitely unofficial.**

To use it you need to sign up at [Tropo](http://www.tropo.com) to get API keys which you then put into the class side #tropoToken methods in TPSmsService and/or TPVoiceService

I've implemented their WebAPI ([docs here](https://www.tropo.com/docs/webapi/new_tropo_web_api_overview.htm)) and you can send and receive SMS messages as well as make/receive telephone calls from Pharo and Gemstone.
